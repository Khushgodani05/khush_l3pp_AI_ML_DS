when we take data as batch from disk if the size is greater than GPU ram size we get an error CUDA out of memory error:
data is more
model is big
nn is responsible for optim which all gradient descent algorithm written
Transfer learning:
Either by changing the entire parameters 
By freezing initial layers and changing last 3-4 layers for our use case
