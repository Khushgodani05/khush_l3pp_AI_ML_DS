regression : prediciting continous numerical value
error: difference between actual and predicted value
features / predictors: the values or variable used to predict something
columns are feature columns
target value: the va;ue which we predict and column is called the target column
Aim in supervised learning: reduce the distance between actual value(ground truth value) and the predicted value
UnsUpervised learning:
regression is not there
clusterring: grouping data based on similarity
Reincforcement learning:
feedback mechanisum is totally dependent on sorrounding and the acty=tion it needs to take 
semi-supervised learning: partial label and maximum unlabelled data
Deep learning:
huge compution powers
effecient for more complex data like image,video, audio
sequential learning:
Time series dataset 
where we include sequence in a learning pattern
