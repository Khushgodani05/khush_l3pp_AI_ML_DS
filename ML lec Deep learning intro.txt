If laptop has GPU: GPU performs parallel computation
cuda toolkit download (middleware between GPU and pytorch code)
then download pytorch
ANN:classification and regression mostly classification for textual data
CNN:for image and video data
RNN: for sequential data it could be either textual , image ,video or any other form 
problem with RNN: It could not data for long time eg(50 frames it forgets initial frames)
Activation function: It is used to break the chaining linearity equation and introduce non-linearity in it
output:sigmoid,softmax
To solve problem of RNN two new architectures i.e LSTM and GPU they could store data for longer time 
Then one architecture better than LSTM and GPU came i.e Transformer
