Numpy directly communicates with hardware so it is faster 
and other python commonicates with hardware through an interpreter

numpy methods:
np.arange(1,3)=[1,2]
np.arange(1,5,2)=[1,3]

pseudo random numbers: tyhe numbers which we genarate with random function is generated by using some algorithm which can be predicted 
random is something which cannot be predicted 
weight initialisation 
dimension of input or output is always 2D or multi dimnesional
